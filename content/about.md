# A little about myself

Hello, I'm Dave. I am a proven Red Team leader with extensive experience managing, leading, planning and executing Red Team operations in multiple industries and disciplines across the globe. I have broad experience in both the Public and Private sectors and have been recognized for my expertise in numerous ways--most recently by being featured in the "Tribe of Hackers: Red Team Edition" book published by Wiley.

### A little about this site

The main motivation for this site is to document and share things as I learn them. As I work on Red Team things and related (or even unrelated!) side projects, I will post what I learn here on a best-effort basis. The end result will probably be part blog, part guide, and part memory aid for myself, but I hope you find it useful as well. Thanks for reading!
