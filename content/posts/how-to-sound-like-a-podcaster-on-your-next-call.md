I covered video in a previous post [(Chroma Keying for Skype in MacOS)](chroma-keying-for-skype-on-macos/), so I thought I would follow that up with a post on audio. Audio quality can make, or break, any call, video, or stream. Think about the last time you tried to watch an interesting looking video on Youtube, only to turn it off due to horrible sound. Or the last time you had a call where you wondered if that one person (you know the one) was actually drowning. Or the mouth-breather. The list goes on...you don't want to be on that list, do you? I thought not. Let's get your audio sorted.
